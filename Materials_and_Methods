In this chapter the assembly of electrodes, experimental setups and analysis methods are explained.
Instruments which were used in general include a vacuum oven (?), a programmable oven, a small dip coater (30\,mm), a large dip coater (1000\,mm), a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT302N by Metrohm), a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM by ?), an ultra-high resolution scanning electron microscope (SU9000 by Hitachi), a pH sensor (?), a Hg/HgSO$_\text{4}$ -- reference electrode (? by Meinsberg), various magnetic stirrers (e.g. MR Hei\_Standard by Heidolph), laboratory hoods, a peristaltic pump (Masterflex L/S HV-07523-80 with Easy Load II pump head EW-77202-60 by Cole Parmer), a proton exchange membrane (Fumapem F-14100 by Fumatech), Parafilm, Sulfuric acid (H$_\text{2}$SO$_\text{4}$, 98\,\% by ?).

First the preparation of the test-electrodes and the GDE is described. Afterwards the experimental setup and analysis methods are explained.

\section {Preparation of CNT Microtubes} \label{micro}

The process for the preparation of CNT microtubes developed at DWI is explained in \cite{Gendel2014}. The used reagents are multi-walled carbonnanotubes (MWCNT) (diameter 6\,--\,9\,nm and 5\,$\mu$m length, purity >\,95\,\% by Sigma Aldrich), Triton--X 100 (Sigma Aldrich) and isopropanol (98\,\% purity by Applichem). Instruments include a sonicator (UP200S by Hielscher), a syringe pump (PHD Ultra by Harvard apparatus) and hollow fiber membranes with a length of 46.5\,cm, an inner diameter of 1.8\,mm and a wall thickness of 0.45\,mm (PP S6/2 by Accurel),

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 1\,g of CNT is mixed with 10\,g of Triton--X 100 in 1\,L of distilled water (18\,m$\Omega$) and stirred for 30\,min
	\item The stirred suspension is sonicated for 3\,h 
	\item One end of the hollow fiber membrane is sealed with adhesive glue
	\item Suspension is dead-end filtrated through hollow fiber membranes with syringe pump at a flow rate of 1\,mL/min
	\item Isopropanol is filtrated through CNT loaded hollow fiber to remove surfactant
	\item Drying of CNT loaded hollow fibers in vacuum oven at 30$\,^\circ\text{C}$
	\item Removing the CNT-microtube by cutting a small (\~1\,cm) part of the hollow fiber wall and pulling out the tube
\end{enumerate}

Additionally the microtube can be heat treated. The hollow fiber membranes are not damaged and can be reused several times during this process. Some microtubes and a SEM image are depicted in figure\,\ref{fig:Microtubes}. Higher resolution SEM pictures are shown subsequently in chapter (?).

%\begin{figure}[h!bt]

	\caption{(a)\,CNT-Microtubes (b)\,Microtube in hollow fiber membrane (c)\,SEM image of microtube cross-section \cite{Gendel2014}}
	\label{fig:Microtubes}
\end{figure}

The optained CNT-microtubes have a length of 44\,cm and an outer diameter of 1,7\,mm. Wall thickness depends on the volume of MWCNT-suspension used for filtration, it amounts to 135\,-\,314\,$\mu$m for volumes of 100\,-\,200\,mL MWCNT-suspension. Properties including density, porosity, pore width, BET surface and electrical conductivity account for 360\,mg/cm$^\text{3}$, 48\,-\,67\,\%, 25\,nm, 217\,m$^\text{2}$/g and 20\,S/cm respectively. Due to these qualities and the tubular shape CNT-microtubes are expected to improve the performance of batteries, fuel cells, redox flow cells, electrochemical capacitors and other electrochemical reactors \cite{Gendel2014}. The main focus in this thesis are advanced oxidation processes.

For the tubes used in this thesis a derived method with constantzpreasure instead of contant flow rate was performed. 200\,mL of MWCNT-solution were filtrated at 50\,psi and 100\,mL of isopropanol were used to flush at 70\,psi. Afterwards no heat treatment was conducted.

\section {Preparation of small CNT Test-Electrodes}

To prove the concept of catalyst application, small CNT electrodes are prepared. Compared to the direct construction of CNT gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) these small CNT-electrodes are easy to assemble and its production is material saving. That way wasting of CNT-microtubes in case of broken electrodes can be prevented. Also they can be easily used as samples for further analysis. The used materials include titanium rods (diameter ? mm), conductive glue (Leit-C by Fluka) and CNT-microtubes (preparation of microtube: see previous chapter\,\ref{micro}).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Cut a 3\,cm piece of a long CNT-microtube
	\item Dip 3\,cm tip of a 10\,cm titanium rod into conductive glue
	\item Immediately insert glued titanium tip into CNT microtube. Simultaneously prevent overflowing glue from touching outer surface of CNT tube by perpetually removing it
	\item Dry prepared test electrodes in vacuum oven for 10\,h at 30$\,^\circ\text{C}$ and 50\,mbar
\end{enumerate}

A test-electrode is shown in figure \ref{fig:test-electrode}.

		\includegraphics[width=0.90\textwidth]{Bilder/test-electrode.pdf}
	\caption{Small CNT-microtube test-electrode (CNT-microtube on Ti-rod)}
	\label{fig:test-electrode}
\end{figure}

\section {Preparation of CNT gas diffusion electrode}

The gas diffusion electrodes were prepared as follows in a laboratory hod. In past many microtubes broke during the process. The construction process has been altered to simplify the production of the GDE. A picture of the assembly is depicted in figure \ref{fig:GDE assembly}.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A stainless steel rod of 30\,cm length and 0.7\,mm diameter is cleaned with isopropanol
	\item A stainless steel (SS) wire with 0.15\,mm diameter is spirally coiled around the rod. At least 40\,cm of the wire are kept uncoiled on both ends
	\item A 30\,cm piece of CNT microtube is cut
	\item One uncoiled end of the wire is threaded through the microtube and tied on the top end of a 50\,cm stand 
	\item The rod is pulled out
	\item The other uncoiled end of the wire is spanned around the lower end of the stand
	\item The microtube is pulled down onto the spirally wire while simultaneously straining the lower uncoiled wire end
	\item After approx. 5\,cm of spiral wire are threaded out of the microtube top, a 40\,cm cleaned stainless steel rod with a diameter of 0,6\,mm is inserted into the spindle within the microtube

	\caption{Assembly of GDE - stainless steel rod is inserted into CNT microtube on spindel}
	\label{fig:GDE assembly}
\end{figure}

	\item As approx. 5\,cm of the rod protrude at both ends of the microtube the loose ends of the wire are cut. The GDE is completed and can be used for further treatment or experimental setups
\end{enumerate}

\section {Coating of CNT-Microtubes}

In this section the different coatings for CNT electrode are described. For coating of CNT tubes the following reagents were used: chloroplatinic acid (H$_\text{2}$PtCl$_\text{6}$, 98\,\% by Sigma Aldrich), Sodium tetrachlorpalladate (Na$_\text{2}$PdCL$_\text{4}$ 98\,\% by Sigma Aldrich), 5\,\% perfluorosulfonic acid (Nafion) in 1-propanol (fumion FLN-90s by Fumatec) and 30\,\% polytetrafluoroethylene in water (PTFE by Fluka) and sodium borohydride (NaBH$_\text{4}^-$ by ?).

\subsection {Nafion and PTFE Coating}

The coating of all small test electrodes was performed with the small dip coater (see figure\,\ref{fig:small dip}). For Nafion and PTFE the CNT-electrodes were dipped into as well as pulled out of the respective solution with a velocity of 45\,mm/min in both cases. The immersion time in between accounts for one minute. Afterwards the electrodes were dried in the vacuum oven overnight at 30$\,^\circ\text{C}$ and 50\,mbar. 

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
	\centering
		\includegraphics [width=0.50\textwidth]{Bilder/small-dip-close.pdf}
	\caption{CNT-electrode attached to small dip coater over platinum solution}
	\label{fig:small dip}
\end{figure}

To finish coatings the Nafion-electrodes were kept in the vacuum oven at 130$\,^\circ\text{C}$ and 50\,mbar for one hour. The PTFE-electrodes were treated in an atmospheric, programmable oven at 250$\,^\circ\text{C}$ raising for 15\,min to 450$\,^\circ\text{C}$.

\subsection {Catalyst Coating} \label{Catalyst}

In this section the catalyst coating of the small CNT-electrodes and the CNT-GDEs is described. The catalyst solutions are prepared with the respective catalyst salt and distilled water. In all catalyst coating procedures the catalyst solution container is chosen as thin as possible to restrict the volume of catalyst solution necessary. The procedure for platinum coating of small pure CNT-electrodes and readily prepared Nafion-electrodes is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The electrodes are immersed in 0.1\,M platinum-solution for 18\,h
	\item pulled out of Pt-solution with a velocity of 46\,mm/min
	\item immersed immediately into fresh 0.1\,M sodium borohydride solution for 1\,min 
	\item pulled out with a velocity of 80\,mm/s
	\item washed in distilled water
	\item dried in vacuum oven overnight at 40$\,^\circ\text{C}$ and 50\,mbar
\end{enumerate}

In case of palladium coating the overall method is the same, instead of Pt-solution two different palladium-solutions are used. To coat CNT- and Nafion-electrodes a platinum-palladium solution with a Pt:Pd-ratio of 1:2 is prepared (c$_\text{Pd}$\,=\,53\,mM, c$_\text{Pt}$\,=\,27\,mM). A 73\,mM palladium solution is used to coat electrodes which were already treated with platinum according to above-described method (platinum-CNT and platinum-Nafion-CNT).

The small electrodes are scaled before and after the catalyst coating to calculate the catalyst-loading. Another method to figure out the loading is to scale the small electrode first before immersion and second after immersion before sodium borohydride treatment. The catalyst loading can be calculated with the following equation:

\begin{equation}
	m_{cat}''=\frac{m_{diff} \cdot c_{cat} \cdot M_{cat}}{\rho_W \cdot A_{electrode}}
\end{equation} 

It is assumed that the catalyst salt has no influence on the solution volume due to its low molarity. Here $\text{m}''_{\text{cat}}$\,[mg/cm$^\text{2}$] is the catalyst loading, $\text{m}_{\text{diff}}$\,[mg] is the mass difference, $\text{c}_{\text{cat}}$\,[M] is the catalyst concentration in solution, $\text{M}_{\text{cat}}$\,[g/mol] is the molar mass of the catalyst and $\rho_{\text{W}}$\,[g/L] is the density of water. $\text{A}_\text{{GDE}}$\,[cm$^\text{2}$] is the surface area of the CNT-microtube which follows from

\begin{equation}
A_{electrode}=\pi \cdot l_{CNT} \cdot \frac{d_{CNT}}{10}
\label{eq:Surface}
\end{equation}

with the length $\text{l}_{\text{CNT}}$\,[cm] and the diameter $\text{d}_{\text{CNT}}$\,[mm] of the CNT-microtube.

Altogether the following small test-electrodes were prepared, scanning electron microscope images (FESEM and SU) are shown in chapter (?):

\begin{itemize}
	\item CNT-microtube
	\item Nafion on CNT-microtube
	\item Platinum on CNT-microtube
	\item Platinum on Nafion-CNT-microtube
	\item Platinum-palladium on CNT-microtube
	\item Palladium on platinum-CNT-microtube
	\item Palladium on platinum-Nafion-CNT-microtube
\end{itemize}

\section {Coating of CNT Gas Diffusion Electrode}

For the coating of the CNT gas diffusion electrodes the procedure is altered. Multiple iterations of the coating process have been performed, the reasons for that are explained in chapter (?). The most successful procedure is described here. Coating is performed using the large dip coater with a stroke length of 1000\,mm. With the following procedure a Pt-CNT-GDE and a Pt/Pd-CNT-GDE were prepared. The solutions are the same as for the small electrodes (0.1\,M Pt-solution and 1:2\,Pt/Pd-solution).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The CNT-GDE is immersed in catalyst solution for 6\,h
	\item GDE is pulled out with a velocity of 45\,mm/s
	\item The ends of the CNT tube are sealed with plastic film and Parafilm on top of it
	\item The GDE is immersed horizontally into a fresh 200\,ml, 0.1\,M sodium borohydride bath for 5\,s
	\item GDE is washed in distilled water immediately
	\item Sealings are removed (with scalpel and tweezers if necessary)
	\item The GDE is dried in vacuum oven overnight at 30$\,^\circ$C and 50\,mbar
\end{enumerate}

To calculate the catalyst-loading a small, scaled tube is used as container for immersion of the GDE. The catalyst solution level inside the scaled tube is noted first before the GDE was immersed and second after the immersion time when the GDE was removed. From the difference of these volumes the catalyst loading can be calculated based on the following equation:
		
		\begin{equation}
	m_{cat}''=\frac{V_{diff}\cdot c_{cat}\cdot M_{cat}}{A_{GDE}}
	\end{equation}
	
Where $\text{m}''_{\text{cat}}$\,[mg/cm$^\text{2}$] is the catalyst loading, $\text{c}_{\text{cat}}$\,[M] is the catalyst concentration in solution, $\text{M}_{\text{cat}}$\,[g/mol] is the molar mass of the catalyst and $\text{V}_{\text{diff}}$\,[ml] is the volume difference and $\text{A}_\text{{GDE}}$\,[cm$^\text{2}$] is the surface area of the CNT-GDE which is calculated similar to equation\,\ref{eq:Surface}.

\subsection {Experimental Setup for Test-Electrodes}

Instruments and reagents used for the electrochemical test-electrode experiments include the potentiostat, a magnetic stirrer, a reference electrode, titanium mesh counter electrode, a platinum-iridium counter electrode, a precise pressure regulator (0\,--\,1.5\,bar), oxygen, nitrogen and sulfuric acid (0.5\,M). 150\,ml of electrolyte (sulfuric acid) are stirred at 500\,rpm in a beaker. Besides of reference- and counter electrode, the 3\,cm CNT-tip of the respective CNT-electrode is immersed as working electrode into the electrolyte and connected to the potentiostat. The reference electrode is placed as near as possible to the working CNT-electrode without contacting it. Gas is supplied through fritted glass in the electrolyte. A scheme and a photograph of the setup are shown below in Figure\,(?) and(?) respectively. All applied electrochemical experiments are described in chapter (?).

\begin{figure}[h]

		\includegraphics[width=1.00\textwidth]{Bilder/test-setup.pdf}
	\caption{Setup for test-electrodes}
	\label{fig:test-setup}
\end{figure}

\subsection {Experimental Setup for Gas Diffusion Electrodes}

The setup for the gas diffusion electrodes includes the module depicted in figure (?), a pump, a stirrer, the potentiostat, the reference electrode, different gases (O$_\text{2}$, N$_\text{2}$), Na2SO4 as electrolyte, H$_\text{2}$SO$_\text{4}$ as alternative electrolyte, a precise pressure regulator, a proton exchange membrane (30\,cm$^\text{2}$), shrinking tubes (with glue inside). The counter electrode is a titanium plate (15\,x\,30\,x\,3\,mm) coated with Pt$_\text{70}$Ir$_\text{30}$  A scheme of the module, which is made of polymethyl metacrylate (PMMA), can be found in annex.

At first the respective gas diffusion electrode has to be prepared for the installation into the module. The procedure is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Two 5\,cm pieces of shrinking tube (3\,mm\,$\rightarrow$\,1\,mm) are cut
	\item The shrinking tubes are pulled over both sides of the CNT microtube of the GDE leaving 20\,cm of microtube free in the middle and approximately 2\,mm of microtube protrude at the outer sides
	\item The shrinking tubes are heated at 250$\,^\circ$C while rotating the microtube and moving it horizontal constantly
	\item Over a length of 2\,cm conductive glue is painted on the current collector to assure a good conjunction between wire and rod. In front of the microtube 5\,mm are let free to prevent the glue from blocking the microtube inlet.
	\item The glues (shrinking tube and conductive glue) are allowed to dry for 2\,h
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\section {Additional Investigations}

In this section additional investigations are described which were performed to assure a CNT-GDE production process without complications. To see the effect of sodium borohydride solution on CNT microtubes, small microtube pieces are put into NaBH$_\text{4}^-$-solutions for different amounts of time and investigated with FESEM. Some microtube pieces are sealed to prevent the solution from flowing inside. Also fresh and older NaBH$_\text{4}^-$-solutions are used to analyze the solution stability. FESEM images of the treated tubes are depicted in chapter (?). Additionally, Parafilm is put into fresh borohydride solution, a CNT-microtube piece, stainless steel rod and stainless steel wire are put into platinum solution to prove the chemical resistance.
